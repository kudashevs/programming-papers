# Important papers on programming and computer science

This is a list of important and interesting papers and publications on programming and computer science. This list
was inspired by a bunch of articles like "Papers Every Programmer Should Read" and it is focused on programming.
It contains well-known and not so well-known papers that are worth reading. Some of these publications made a revolution
in programming, some not, but all of them impacted our industry somehow.
